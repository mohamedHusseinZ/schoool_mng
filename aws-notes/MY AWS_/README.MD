t looks like you're facing two separate issues here: incorrect permissions on your PEM file and the attempt to check the status of the httpd service, which might not be installed or correctly referenced.

Fixing PEM File Permissions
To correct the permissions on the PEM file, you need to ensure it is only readable by the owner. Here's how you can do it:

Set the Correct Permissions:

sh
Copy code
chmod 400 labsuser.pem
Verify Permissions:

You can check the permissions with the ls -l command:

sh
Copy code
ls -l labsuser.pem
You should see something like this:

sh
Copy code
-r-------- 1 user user 1692 Jun 3 12:34 labsuser.pem
Connect to the EC2 Instance Again:

Now, try connecting again:

sh
Copy code
ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@35.87.139.61
Checking and Starting the httpd Service on EC2
If you're trying to manage the httpd service on your EC2 instance, you first need to ensure it's installed. Here’s how to do it:

Connect to Your EC2 Instance:

Follow the steps above to SSH into your EC2 instance.

Check if httpd is Installed:

Once connected, check the status of the httpd service:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl status httpd
If it says "Unit httpd.service could not be found", you need to install it.

Install httpd (if not already installed):

Install httpd (Apache) using the package manager. On Amazon Linux, you can use:

sh
Copy code
sudo yum install httpd -y
Start and Enable the httpd Service:

After installing, start the service and enable it to start on boot:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
Check the Status Again:

Verify that httpd is running:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl status httpd
Complete Steps
Set Permissions on PEM File:

sh
Copy code
chmod 400 labsuser.pem
Connect to EC2 Instance:

sh
Copy code
ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@35.87.139.61
Install and Manage httpd Service:

Once connected to the EC2 instance:

sh
Copy code
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
sudo systemctl status httpd
This should solve the issues you're facing with connecting to your EC2 instance and managing the httpd service.

It appears that the yum command is not recognized on your local machine, which suggests you're running a Linux distribution that uses a different package manager. Typically, yum is used on CentOS, RHEL, and Amazon Linux. On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you would use apt.

Using apt on Ubuntu/Debian
If you're on an Ubuntu or Debian-based system, you can install Apache (httpd) using apt. Here are the steps:

Update the Package List:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt update
Install Apache:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt install apache2 -y
Start and Enable Apache:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
Check Apache Status:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl status apache2
Managing httpd on an EC2 Instance
If you're trying to install and manage httpd on your EC2 instance instead of your local machine, you'll need to SSH into your EC2 instance first. Here are the steps to do that on an EC2 instance running Amazon Linux, CentOS, or RHEL:

SSH into the EC2 Instance:

sh
Copy code
ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@35.87.139.61
Check if httpd is Installed:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl status httpd
Install httpd on Amazon Linux/CentOS/RHEL:

If the httpd service is not found, install it using yum:

sh
Copy code
sudo yum install httpd -y
Start and Enable httpd:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd
Check httpd Status:

sh
Copy code
sudo systemctl status httpd
Summary
To recap, you'll need to differentiate between managing services on your local machine and your EC2 instance. Use apt for local Ubuntu/Debian-based systems and yum for Amazon Linux/CentOS/RHEL-based EC2 instances.

If you need to install and manage httpd on your local Ubuntu system, use the apt commands. If you're trying to do this on your EC2 instance, first SSH into the instance and then use the yum commands to manage httpd.

If you run into any specific issues with these commands, feel free to ask!

The error message indicates that the permissions on your labsuser.pem file are too open, making the private key file insecure. The correct permissions should restrict access so that only the owner can read it.

To fix this, you should set the permissions to 400, ensuring that only the file owner has read access. Here’s the corrected sequence of commands:

Set the Correct Permissions:

sh
Copy code
chmod 400 labsuser.pem
Verify the Permissions:

Confirm that the permissions are set correctly using ls -l:

sh
Copy code
ls -l labsuser.pem
The output should look like this:

sh
Copy code
-r-------- 1 user user 1692 Jun 3 12:34 labsuser.pem
Connect to the EC2 Instance:

After ensuring the permissions are correct, try connecting to your EC2 instance again:

sh
Copy code
ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@35.87.139.61
Complete Example
Here is the complete sequence of commands:

Change to the Directory Containing the PEM File:

sh
Copy code
cd /mnt/c/Users/PC/Downloads/
Set the Correct Permissions on the PEM File:

sh
Copy code
chmod 400 labsuser.pem
Verify the Permissions:

sh
Copy code
ls -l labsuser.pem
Ensure the output looks correct:

sh
Copy code
-r-------- 1 user user 1692 Jun 3 12:34 labsuser.pem
SSH into the EC2 Instance:

sh
Copy code
ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@35.87.139.61
Example Session
Here’s how the commands should be executed:

sh
Copy code
zaki@zaki:~$ cd /mnt/c/Users/PC/Downloads/
zaki@zaki:/mnt/c/Users/PC/Downloads$ chmod 400 labsuser.pem
zaki@zaki:/mnt/c/Users/PC/Downloads$ ls -l labsuser.pem
-r-------- 1 zaki zaki 1692 Jun 3 12:34 labsuser.pem
zaki@zaki:/mnt/c/Users/PC/Downloads$ ssh -i labsuser.pem ec2-user@35.87.139.61
This should allow you to connect to your EC2 instance without any permission errors.
